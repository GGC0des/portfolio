      About me <span>👩🏻‍💻</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Junior Software Developer with a passion for creating impactful applications and several years of experience working closely with tech teams. I will forget about time when fixing a bug.
      <br> <br>
      I have a master's degree in Digital Entrepreneurship and (re-) discovered my passion for tech and coding whilst working on multiple website & database projects.
      <br> <br>
      As a former Campaign Director at an animal rights NGO I was resposible to drive meaningful change and achieved +50K signups within 2 months & media coverage by Zeit Online for one of my campaigns.
      With my background in business development, project management and strategic partnerships, I bring a unique perspective to software development:
      Understanding both technical execution & stakeholder needs.
      <br> <br> Managing those tech projects motivated me to complete an 11-week Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon where I learnt how to build user-friendly apps and collaborate with other developers on Github.
      My pitch for PetPatron was selected as a final project for which I was also chosen team lead by my peers and group members.
      As team lead for PetPatron I contributed 80% of the backend using Ruby on Rails and implemented frontend features with JavaScript.
      Since then, I dedicated my time to advance my programming skills further by learning Java.
      <br> <br> My true passion is playing around with refactoring code to compare different approaches of applying logic which I would love to do full-time as your new Junior Java Developer 👩🏻‍💻🚀✨

    <h3>
      Web App PetPatron
    </h3>
    <p>
      My idea for PetPatron - a web app to locally connect animal lovers with shelters - was selected as a final project at the LeWagon Bootcamp. Chosen as Team Lead by my peers and group members I managed Trello workflows (Kanban method), lead daily stand-ups and reviewed pull requests on GitHub.
      I programmed 80% of the backend in Ruby on Rails, including dashboard logic for different types of users & multi-search including tags & Mapbox. On the frontend I contributed JavaScript features using Stimulus framework for search elements and different views depending whether the user is logged in or not.

    <h3> Second Brain with Obsidian </h3>
    <p> To advance my programming knowledge learnt in the bootcamp I wanted to focus on the fundamentals of software engigneering.
      Whilst doing CodeCademy courses and learning Java I started to build a Second Brain - a method by Tiago Forte to create a personal Wiki.
      I set up Obsidian to create this Second Brain and studied programming fundamentals as outlined by Roadmap.sh.
      To make this theory approach more hands-on, I compared statically typed (Java) vs. dynamically typed (Ruby) languages by refactoring simple coding exercises.
      My goal was to deepen my knowledge of of OOP as well as (backend) programming concepts.
